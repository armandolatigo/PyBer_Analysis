# PyBer_Analysis

Exploratory Analysis on PyBer, a ride-sharing company viva Python // Pandas // Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of Analysis

The analysis took a sample size of time from January - April 2019 and procured data on number of total rides, drivers, and fares as well as average fare per ride and average fare per driver for three types of markets: urban, suburban, and rural areas.

### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis was to see which markets were in need of more company support in terms of affordability and availability for and to PyBer services.

## Results

### City Data

IMG

As expected, the rural market has scarcity price issue.  Less drivers and the demand for PyBer services would seem high since the price per driver and per ride exceed those of suburban and urban markets

### Timeline Data

IMG

-Urban market fares have an incremental result with major shifts but remain higher than from then beginnning of the data
-Suburban market fares have shown a similar result to the urban market.  Less major shifts but major leaps in two points of time.
-Rural areas show the most stability in pricing over time with very little change.

## Summmary

PyBer should investigate incentivizing drivers to serve rural markets to decrease pricing, investigate the price spikes in suburban and urban markets, and perhaps set a fare cap during peak times in those markets to stay competitive and more appealing than other ride-share services.
